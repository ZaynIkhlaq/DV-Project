# Rethinking Prosperity

A data visualization presentation exploring the relationship between economic growth and human wellbeing. Through interactive charts and visualizations, this project examines the hidden costs of consumerism: atomized families, mental health crises, demographic decline, and the erosion of wellbeing in even the wealthiest nations.

## About

This presentation challenges conventional assumptions about prosperity by revealing the complex relationships between economic development and social outcomes. Through 19 interactive visualizations, it exposes how wealth doesn't guarantee happiness, how development strains manifest in mental health crises, and how traditional social structures are eroding even in the most prosperous societies.

## The Story

The presentation begins with economic indicators—GDP growth, urbanization, and development trends—then progressively reveals the darker side of progress. It examines how inequality concentrates wealth at the top, how fertility rates collapse as nations develop, how suicide rates don't decrease with wealth, and how social atomization increases alongside economic prosperity.

## Key Themes

### Economic Growth vs. Human Wellbeing
- The disconnect between GDP growth and life satisfaction
- How mental health crises persist in wealthy nations
- The correlation between economic development and social fragmentation

### Inequality and Concentration
- Wealth concentration in the top 10% of populations
- The relationship between inequality and social outcomes
- How economic precarity affects all income levels

### Demographic Decline
- Global fertility rates falling below replacement levels
- The collapse of traditional family structures
- Aging populations and their impact on social systems

### Social Atomization
- The rise of single-person households
- Declining social bonds despite economic prosperity
- The erosion of community and family structures

### Wellbeing Factors
- What truly correlates with human flourishing
- The factors that predict high wellbeing (education, child poverty reduction)
- The factors that predict low wellbeing (suicide rates, debt burden, inequality)

## Visualizations

The presentation includes 19 slides featuring:

- **Global Economic Trends**: GDP per capita, GNI trends, and economic growth patterns
- **Urbanization Map**: An interactive world map showing urbanization percentages over time
- **Development Indicators**: Life expectancy, literacy rates, and healthcare metrics
- **Correlation Analysis**: Relationships between socioeconomic factors
- **Inequality Visualizations**: Gini indices, wealth concentration, and distribution patterns
- **Mental Health Data**: Suicide rates correlated with economic indicators
- **Demographic Trends**: Fertility rates, household structures, and population changes
- **Country Comparisons**: Multi-dimensional profiles comparing nations across various metrics
- **Wellbeing Analysis**: Factors that predict high and low wellbeing scores

## The Message

This project argues that economic growth alone is insufficient for human flourishing. True prosperity requires balancing material wealth with social cohesion, mental health support, and sustainable demographic structures. The data reveals that some of the world's wealthiest nations face the greatest challenges in maintaining social bonds, mental health, and demographic stability.

Through data visualization, we expose the hidden costs of progress and invite viewers to rethink what prosperity truly means.
